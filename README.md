# DDoSAnom Project Overview

**DDoSAnom** is a high-performance DDoS simulation tool designed to assess the robustness and security of web servers.  
This program supports both **UDP Flood** and **TCP Flood** attack methods, which are commonly used in real-world network environments,  
allowing users to easily simulate a wide variety of traffic load scenarios.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

After launching the program, users can input the following information:

- **Target server’s URL or IP address**
- **Port number**
- **Packet size**

Once these parameters are set, **DDoSAnom** transmits a large volume of packets to the specified server using the selected method (**UDP** or **TCP**),  
creating an artificial load that closely mimics a real DDoS attack environment.

- **UDP Flood** mode rapidly generates massive amounts of traffic, making it ideal for testing a server’s bandwidth and processing capabilities.
- **TCP Flood** mode establishes actual network connections, enabling you to evaluate a server’s session handling and connection management limits.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of packet transmission, cumulative data volume, error counts, and more
- **Simple, intuitive UI** that makes load testing accessible even for beginners
- **Flexible switching** between UDP and TCP modes to suit various test purposes

## 🛡️ Intended Use

DDoSAnom is a powerful tool for:

- Server administrators
- Network engineers
- Security researchers
- Anyone who wants to proactively evaluate the stability, vulnerabilities, and defensive readiness of their server environment

> **⚠️ Please note:**  
> DDoSAnom is intended strictly for ethical and legal testing purposes—**use only on servers you own or have explicit permission to test**.  
> Unauthorized attacks or illegal use are strictly prohibited.
